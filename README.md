# üó∫Ô∏è roadmap.sh - Frontend Components

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects based on frontend components, organized as part of the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) learning path. Each folder within the `frontEnd` directory represents an individual component that you can study, modify, and test separately.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- Each subfolder within `frontEnd` represents a mini-project or component.
- Within each folder, you will find the files related to that component, and an `image.png` image showing the solution or expected result of the component.
